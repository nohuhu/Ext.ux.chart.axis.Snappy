/*
 * This is an attempt at creating numeric chart Axis with predictable placement
 * of major ticks. Axis ends are calculated based on user provided min and max
 * values, snapping at the nearest logical (or sometimes not) points.
 *
 * Usage: like ordinary Axis, except min and max values should be set explicitly.
 * See demo application for more details.
 *
 * Version 0.99, compatible with Ext JS 4.1.1.
